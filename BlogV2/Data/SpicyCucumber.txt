Seasoned Spicy Cucumber
Inspired by Din Tai Fung
Spicy cucumber was probably one of the most memorable dishes for me when I went to eat at Din Tai Fung. Unfortunately, I wasn\'92t able to eat the dumplings since they are not GF so I can\'92t comment on that too much. It did look amazing, and from my friends experience they would highly recommend it. The cucumbers were extremely refreshing. It was nutty, tangy and sweet with a bit of a kick. What made it so memorable it simply how easy it looked to make yet it was so tasty. After a bit of googling and working with what I had on hand this is what I came up with.

Step 1
Slightly bash the cucumber on all sides whilst it is still whole. This creates crevices in the cucumber for the seasoning to seep into. This is probably the most important step and should definitely not be skipped! If you were to slice the cucumbers without bashing it before hand when you toss the seasonings into the cucumbers it would slide off and nowhere to seep through.
Step 2 
Slice the cucumber into bite size pieces and add a bit of salt to the cucumber and mix gently. Place it aside for 20mins. This step allows the excess moisture to drain from the cucumber. After the 20mins you should see a little puddle of liquid that has collected at the bottom of the dish. If we skipped this step, the excess liquid would water down the seasoning off the cucumbers and make it bland. 
Step 3 
Once you've drained all the liquid from the cucumbers. Add into the same bowl, sesame oil, pepper, chili oil, rice vinegar and sugar and mix! Add little by little to taste! Everyone's taste bud is difference so adjust to your preferences.
